Employee Attrition Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using supervised learning algorithms. Through data preprocessing, exploratory
analysis, model training, and evaluation, we compare the performance of various classifiers including KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic
Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Classifiers (SVC). 
The goal is to identify key patterns that help anticipate potential employee burnout or resignation.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
